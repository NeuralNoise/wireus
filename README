Prerequisites
=============

The following software packages are *required* for this software to
run correctly.

- PHP 5.2.3+. It may be possible to run this software on earlier
  versions of PHP, but many of the functions used are only available
  in PHP 5.2 or above. 5.2.6 or later. PHP 5.3.x should work correctly in this
  release.
  
- MySQL 5.x. or PostgreSQL 8.4+.

Your PHP installation must include the following PHP extensions:

- GD (php5-gd). For image thumbnailing   


Installation
============


1. Unpack the tarball you downloaded on your Web server. e.g.

       tar zxf wireus-0.1.1.tar.gz

   ...which will make a wireus-0.1.1 subdirectory in your current
   directory. (If you don't have shell access on your Web server, you
   may have to unpack the tarball on your local computer and FTP the
   files to the server.)

2. Move the tarball to a directory of your choosing in your Web root
   directory. e.g.
       mv wireus-0.1.1 /var/www/wireus

   This will make your Wireus instance available in the your server, like "http://sample.com/wireus".  
   
3. Make your target directory writeable by the Web server.

       e.g. chmod 777 /var/www/wireus/

   On some systems, this will probably work:

       chgrp www-data /var/www/wireus/
       chmod g+w /var/www/wireus/


4. Create a database in pgsql or mysql.

   Note that WIREUS must have its own database; you can't share the
   database with another program. You can name it whatever you want,
   though.

5. Create a new database account that Wireus will use to access the
   database. Grant all permissions for the database user account, 
   (users are called ROLES in postgreSQL)


6. Create the tables as specified in the file named "SQLSETUPs" in the
   wireus folder.
   
7. Rename rename.connectionfile.php (in the lib/ directory) to connectionfile.php, and specify the names of all the variables as
   mentioned in the file
